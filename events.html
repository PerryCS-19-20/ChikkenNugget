It takes patience and understanding to teach, and Mr. Harpur has both. He is firm, but fair, and flexible. However, his expectations are high and he expects all students to match his 100% dedication to World History and Geography, and education in general. It is his request that all students take a risk and try to do their best in order to learn their place in the world and how they can make a difference in the lives of possibly hundreds of people by applying their knowledge and skills to their future careers. As an instructor, Mr. Harpur brings many years of successful business and teaching experience to the classroom. His experiences include living on three continents (Africa, Europe, and North America); Boy Scout leadership; and extensive travel in the U.S. and Canada. His education includes a B.A. degree in History, M.Ed. degree in Curriculum Development and Leadership, and a Principalship Certificate. Mr. Harpur is looking forward to a great year as a Perry Puma!
